# Problem 1 - Solved 4/19/2022
> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
> https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

1. Generate List from 1 to 999
2. Filter all values which are not multiples of 3 or 5
3. Sum using foldLeft

# Problem 2 - Solved 4/19/2022
> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

1. Generate fibonacci as stream
2. TakeWhile value is less than 4,000,000
3. Filter on even numbers
4. Sum using foldLeft

# Problem 4 - Solved 4/20/2022
> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
> https://projecteuler.net/problem=4

1. Generate x and y ranges between 100 and 999
2. find the cartesian product between the two ranges
3. Cross multiply the x and y positions in the tuples
4. Filter on palindromes
5. Reduce the list by the max function
